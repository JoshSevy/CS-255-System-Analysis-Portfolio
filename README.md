# CS-255 System Analysis & Design Portfolio
**Southern New Hampshire University**  
*Course: CS-255 System Analysis and Design*

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my work in system analysis and design, demonstrating my
ability to collect requirements from customers and design systems that meet
their needs. The project focuses on the DriverPass system, a comprehensive
web-based platform for driver training and test preparation.

## DriverPass System Analysis and Design Project

### Project Summary

The DriverPass project involved creating a system for a company that helps
students get ready for their driving tests. The client wanted a web-based
platform that would allow students to buy training packages, book lessons, take
practice tests, and view their progress. The system also needed to help
instructors and administrators with scheduling, user account management, and
report generation. Our main goal was to understand the business needs and design
a system that made things easier and more efficient for everyone involved.

### Project Reflection

#### What I Did Well

I did a good job turning business requirements into clear system models and
diagrams. I made sure each UML diagram showed real user workflows, not just
technical details. By linking requirements to how the system works, I designed
payment and lesson scheduling processes that matched how users would use the
system. I also worked to make the documentation clear so that other developers
or stakeholders could understand it easily.

#### What I Would Revise or Improve

If I were to go back and change anything in my work, I would add more
information to the system design documentation, particularly regarding error
handling and unusual events. Although the normal events were well understood, I
could have modeled more information regarding events such as scheduling
conflicts or system failures. Adding these improvements would demonstrate how
the system functions under real-world conditions rather than ideal conditions.

#### Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them

Throughout this project, I tried to understand the specific requirements of each
group of users, including students, instructors, and administrators, that this
system had for this system. These requirements are then turned into features
such as scheduling, tracking, and payments, among others. It is essential to
consider user requirements because, even if a system is technically sound, it
may not work as intended if users are not considered during its design. This is
because considering users ensures that a system is user-friendly, effective, and
addresses all business concerns.

#### My Approach to Software Design

When creating a system, I always try to understand the problem from a user's and
a business's point of view before deciding how to implement a solution. Ideally,
I think about the system's workflows first, then think about data and
connections between system components. So far, I plan to continue applying
techniques such as UML modeling, iterative refinement, and testing against user
scenarios to validate my ideas. However, in the future, I would also try to get
feedback early to ensure my assumptions are correct and avoid more work later.
